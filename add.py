I didn't set this up. It was already in place; I just happened to discover it accidentally. ðŸ˜Š That said, I believe itâ€™s quite helpful and offers several benefits, including:

Consistency: By providing a centralized view, you can immediately see all items assigned to you, even if theyâ€™re not included in a sprint. This makes it easy to keep track of all your work.

Visibility:

Related Items: While working on a story, if you come across something related to an unassigned story or a story that should be in the sprint, you have the flexibility to move or assign it to yourself.
Comprehensive Overview: The platform displays everythingâ€”features, epics, tasks within the epic, subtasks, and so on. You donâ€™t need to click around to view tasks, epics, or features; everything is readily accessible.
Efficiency in Workflow:

Quick Assignment: You can reassign tasks or stories on the go without the need to navigate multiple menus.
Progress Tracking: The platform helps in understanding dependencies and progress at a glance, reducing the need to switch between views.
Collaboration: This setup encourages collaboration by making it easier for team members to see what others are working on and identify overlapping areas or tasks that may need attention.

Let me know if you have any questions or if thereâ€™s anything youâ€™d like to add!
